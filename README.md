# Philosophers
"Philosophers" is the first project aiming to demonstrate how to create, use, and manage multiple threads while avoiding any data conflicts or data races using mutex and a custom function call "ft_usleep" that should be implemented using gettimeofday. It will also explore the creation, usage, and management of processes, ensuring data integrity through the implementation of semaphores to avoid data conflicts and data races. The idea of the project is to create a program that takes its parameters from the user and runs a simulation of the philosophers' problem.
